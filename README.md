# Amarian Campbell portfolio repository

## Welcome to my repository!

In this repository, you will find a selection of projects and code that I have been working on. I have included a variety of programming languages and frameworks, ranging from 2D games to even the creation of my own site.

One of the main projects in this repository is the repository responsible for housing my "about me" website. It's important because it gives employers a quick and easy way to access all of my socials in one place It was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript i believe.

Another notable project is a the framework i used to recreate the legendary arcade game "pacman". This was my first attempt at a large scale c++ project and i found it extremely fun and challenging.

Soon, in addition to these larger projects, a number of smaller code snippets and scripts will begin to appear in this repository. These include things like utility functions and data processing scripts, which demonstrate my skills in these areas.

I hope that you find something of interest in this repository. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!
